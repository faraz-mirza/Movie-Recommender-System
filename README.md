# Movie-Recommender-System

- The folder contains 2 ipython notebook files and 2 CSV files.
- You will need python 3.x version and anaconda installed in your system to run these in Jupyter.
- The ipynb and CSV files should be in the same folder otherwise will generate an error.
- The ratings dataset is too big. If your system's RAM is less than 8 GB, It might generate a memory exception in between.
- You might have to close down all other applications you're running at that time to keep the memory free. In case it still causes
  the problem, increase the threshold number in the 13th cell of Collaborative Filtering.ipynb
- The data files are too big to upload, kindly download it from http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-20m.zip and extract
  it in the same folder as the Jupyter files.
